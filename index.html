                    <p>Christina is originally from California, but she has lived in Washington, DC since 2004. In between she spent several years in Georgia. Christina has too many hobbies - reading, writing, decorating cakes, sewing clothing, designing websites, studying languages, watching movies and playing with her niece and nephew. She loves animals, but is not allowed to have one by her mean landlords. Her favorite shows are the Golden Girls and Bob's Burgers.</p>

                    <p>Christina is currently in the GW Full Stack Developer program because she can't figure out her life. She studied History and then got a Master's Degree from GW's Elliott School of International Affairs. After working at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC for many years, she decided to change careers. Christina completed a post-bacc pre-med program at Georgetown. She did not enjoy it. After that expensive false start, she took a Front-End web development class at General Assembly. She did enjoy that. At that point she was dangerously low on money, so Christina began designing websites for a few clients. She realized she needed to work on her coding skills - hence the GW Bootcamp.</p>
